this course cover:
1. finding and extracting raw data
2. tidy data principles and how to make it tidy
3. practical implementation through a range of R packages

the goral of this course
raw data  -> processing script -> tidy data -> (data analysis)  -> (data communciation)

raw and process data##################################################################
"data are values of qualitative or quantitative variable, belonging to a set of items" from wiki
qualitative: country of origin, sex, treatment
quantitative: height, weight, blood pressure

raw data vs processed data
raw data
1. the original source of the data
2. ofter hard to used for data analysis
3. data analysis includes data processing
4. raw data may only need to be processed once

processed data
1. data that is ready for analysis
2. processing data include merging, subsetting, transforming, etc
3. there may be standards for processing
4. all steps should be recorded

the components of tidy data#######################################################
four things you should have 
1. the raw data
2. a tidy data
3. a codebook describing each variables and its values in the tidy data set
4. an explicit and exact recipe you used to go from step 1 to step 2&3

the raw data
1. the strand binary file your measurement machine spits out
2. the unformatted excel file with 10 worksheets the company you contracted with sent you
3. the complicated JSON data you got from scraping the Twitter API
4. the hand-enter numbers you collected looking through a microscope

you know the raw data is in the right format if you
1. ran no software on the data
2. did not manipulate any of the numbers of data
3. you did not remove any data from the data set
4. you did not summarize the data in any way

th tidy data
1. each variable you measure should be in one column
2. each different obs of that variable should be in a different row
3. there should one table for each "kind" of variable
4. if you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked

some other importants tips
1. include a row at the top of each file with variable names
2. make variable names human readable AgeAtDiagnosis instead of AgeDx
3. in general data should be save in one file per table

https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing

the code book
1. info about the variables (including units) in the data set not contained in the tidy data
2. info about the summary choices you made
3. info about the experimental study design you used

some other important tips
1. a common format for this document is a word/text file, markerdown
2. there should be a section called "study design" that has a thorough description of how you collected the data
3. there must be a section called "code book" that describes each variable and its units

the instruction list
1. ideally a computer script in R/Python
2. the input for the script is the raw data
3. the output is the processed tidy data
4. there are no parameters to the script

in some cases it will not be possible to script every step, in that case you shold provide instructions like:
1. step 1 - take the raw file, run version 3.1.2 of summarize software with parameters a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
2. step 2 - run the software separately for each sample
3. step 3 - take column three of outputfile.out for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data set
